Supp_mat_1 contains all the R code needed to reproduce our analysis in an accessible R Markdown document. 

Supp_mat_2 contains the errors of the estimates of mean occupancy, the trend and the relative frequencies of the auxiliaries for each estimator. It has one tab for each. For mean occupancy, we present absolute errors; for the trend, we provide the differences between the truth and the estimates; and for the relative frequencies of the auxiliaries, we provid the mean absolute errors across bins.
